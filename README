StringFinder:
A small program for finding string-like expressions
inside a file or directory containing code.
The file and line will always be displayed.
The user has the option of showing only the found strings,
or the whole line, with the strings highlighted.

Building and Installing:
Just run "make", and "string_finder" will appear inside the "src" directory.

When compiled out of the box, the code is optimized,
and does not include debug information and output.
These settings can be changed in the "_CPPFLAGS" variable in "common.mk":
To add debug output, add "-D DEBUG".
To add debug information to the binary, add "-g".
"-O3" is the optimization flag, which you can remove or change.

In "common.mk" you can also change "CC" to any GCC-compatible compiler.

"string_finder": Run "./string_finder [target file or directory] [mode]".
	A mode value of "a" will run string-only mode,
	in which only the found strings are displayed.
	A mode value of "l" will run whole-line mode
	in which only all the lines containing strings are displayed.
	If the mode is omitted, the mode will be string-only by default.
